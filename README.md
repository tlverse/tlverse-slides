# `tlverse` workshop at SER 2021 [![Booklet](https://github.com/tlverse/ser2021-workshop/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tlverse/ser2021-workshop/actions/workflows/bookdown.yml) [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tlverse/ser2021-workshop/master?urlpath=rstudio)

Welcome to the GitHub repository accompanying a half-day (4-hour) workshop on
Targeted Learning with the `tlverse` software ecosystem, given (virtually) at
the [SER 2021
Meeting](https://epiresearch.org/annual-meeting/2021-meeting/workshop/) on
Monday, 07 June 2021. These teaching materials are adapted from a draft of the
forthcoming book [*Targeted Learning in `R`: Causal Data Science with the
`tlverse` Software Ecosystem*](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook/), by Mark
van der Laan, Jeremy Coyle, Nima Hejazi, Ivana Malenica, Rachael Phillips, and
Alan Hubbard. The unabridged book is [freely
available](https://tlverse.org/tlverse-handbook); its source materials may be
found in the corresponding public [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/tlverse/tlverse-handbook).

The workshop materials are automatically built and deployed using
[Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), which supports using R and
RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific snapshot on
[MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility). An RStudio
session, pre-loaded with all the materials, is available via the "launch binder"
button at the top of this page.
